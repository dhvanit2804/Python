'What is Virtual Enviroment in Python ?'
'A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. '
'It helps to avoid conflicts between packages and ensures that each project has its own set of libraries and versions, '
'independent of the global Python installation. This is particularly useful when working on multiple projects that '
'may require different versions of the same package.'

'''An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other 
Python environments on the system.'''
