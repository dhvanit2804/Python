# DEFINATION OF WHILE LOOP
# While loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.

'''In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop 
is executed otherwise not! 
If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until 
the condition becomes False.''' 

'''Syntax Of While loop

    code to be executed
